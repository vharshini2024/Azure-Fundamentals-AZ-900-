**If you want to create a Azure Subscription**
Option 1 : To Create Azure Free Subscription :::
Note : Use your own email id
 
Sign up for an Azure account:
Go to the Azure website (https://azure.microsoft.com/) and click on the "Start free" button.
You will be prompted to sign in with a Microsoft account or create one if you don't have one already.

After signing in, you'll need to provide some basic information, including your name, email address, phone number, and country/region.

Microsoft may require you to verify your identity through a phone number or credit card verification. This is to prevent abuse of the free trial offer.

Review the terms of use and privacy policy, then check the box to agree to the terms and click "Sign up."
